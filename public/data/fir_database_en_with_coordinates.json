They were on their way to Shahagad to buy vegetables on a red Hero Passion motorcycle. Near S.S. Chaudhary Dhaba, on the service road east of NH 52 highway, a John Deere tractor (MH-21-BV-7938) driven by Balu Gorakh Tandale hit them from behind. Both Anil Kumar and Rinku Sharma were seriously injured and taken to Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. Anil Kumar was later shifted to the Ghatti Hospital for further treatment but succumbed to his injuries on 03/02/2024. Due to the trauma, Rameshkumar could only file the report on 05/03/2024, after returning from his village.  He alleges that the tractor driver, Balu Gorakh Tandale, was driving recklessly and negligently, causing the accident and the death of his son.",

Khandagale had sustained a fractured leg and severe head injuries. The police had impounded both the motorcycle and the cruiser (MH-24-AF-6082).

Witnesses claimed the four-wheeler had hit Angad's motorcycle head-on. Angad was taken to Ashti Primary Health Center and then referred to Jalna District General Hospital where he was declared dead. The next day, police conducted a panchnama and a post-mortem was performed.

Kendre informed her about an unidentified person, injured in an accident near Jagdamba Hotel, Lalwadi, Ambad, being brought to Ambad Sub-District Hospital in a private ambulance (MH.04.CP.4558). An Accidental Death Report (ADR) was registered, and an investigation revealed injuries consistent with a road accident. The deceased, approximately 40 years old, was wearing a green, full-sleeved shirt and black night pants. A post-mortem was conducted. Despite attempts to identify the deceased, including circulating a search report, the identity remained unknown. Based on the circumstances, it appears an unknown vehicle driver, driving recklessly and negligently, hit the deceased on 29/08/2024 at 11:30 PM on Jalna-Beed Highway Road, causing fatal injuries. The driver fled the scene without reporting the accident. The complainant requests legal action against the unknown driver under sections 106(1), 281, 125(a), 125(b) of IPC, and 134/177 of MVA.",

He was riding his motorcycle (MH21.AC.5975) with his cousin, Sainath Vishnu Gandule, as a passenger. They were returning from Ambad after purchasing tin sheets. Around 3:30 PM, while approaching a speed breaker near Polytechnic College, a speeding white car (MH.25.R.0500) rear-ended their motorcycle.  Sainath suffered a severe head injury and was rushed to the hospital, where he was declared dead. Ramesh sustained minor injuries. The car driver did not stop. The delay in filing the FIR is attributed to the family's grief and religious rituals.",

On 22/01/2024, around 9 PM, Sunil, who owned and drove a small truck (MH20E13965), picked up Vaijinath for a trip to Sambhaji Nagar.  While driving near Somthana, the truck overturned into a field after Sunil swerved to avoid the headlights of an oncoming vehicle. Vaijinath was thrown from the vehicle and lost consciousness. He regained consciousness at Badnapur Government Hospital around 11:30 PM with injuries to his left hand, shoulder, right knee, head, and chest. The next morning, Sunil's relative informed Vaijinath that Sunil had died in the accident. Vaijinath states that the accident was caused by the oncoming vehicle's headlights and the sudden turn, not by any collision or intentional act.",

On 18/03/2023, after dinner, around 11:30 PM, Ayaz, Farhan, and their friend Mujahid went to Devthana. While returning to Mantha between 12:30 AM and 1:00 AM, they stopped for tea near Devthana.  While they were at the tea stall, Farhan went to urinate.  As they were paying the bill, a speeding red Eicher truck (MH-48 CB-1179) coming from Mantha towards Jalna hit a parked brick-colored Eicher truck (MH-20 EG-9555).  The speeding truck lost control, veered towards the pedestrian path, and hit Farhan who was standing near the roadside. The truck then overturned, trapping Farhan underneath.  Farhan died on the spot.  People from the hotel and passersby rushed to the scene. Ayaz called his family.  The injured were taken to the government hospital in Mantha in a private ambulance. Farhan's body was extricated from under the truck using a crane.  His body was sent to the Mantha government hospital for postmortem. The next day, after the postmortem, the body was handed over to the relatives for last rites. Due to the grief and the religious rituals, the complaint was filed the following day. Ayaz requests legal action against the driver of the truck MH-48 CB-1179 for causing Farhan's death by driving recklessly and negligently.",

Around 2:30 PM, Suresh called and informed her about Vishnu's accident at Gul Khand Fata. They took him to a government hospital in Vatur. Later, Suresh informed her that due to severe injuries, Vishnu was referred to Kalavati Hospital, Jalna, and then to Jalna District General Hospital. Suresh explained that while returning from Vatur Fata, they stopped at a juice stall. While Vishnu was on a call, a silver Swift car (MH-02 AP-2435) speeding from Jintur towards Jalna hit him from behind. The driver fled the scene without helping. With the help of bystanders, they took Vishnu to Jalna, where he was declared dead.  After the post-mortem, they performed the last rites. Kashibai requests action against the driver of MH-02 AP-2435 for causing her husband's death due to reckless driving.",
